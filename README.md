--- Technologies, Libraries, APIs ---

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- the Canvas API to render the game board 
- Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code




--- Implementation Timeline ---

🕐 Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. 

🕐 Monday: Ensure that I can advance a generation and all the cells update appropriately. If time, make sure this is all rendered correctly on the canvas.

🕐 Tuesday: If I didn't get to it already, get the cells correctly rendered to the canvas. Make sure they rerender correctly when I advance a generation. Then, focus on user controls. 

🕐 Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. 

🕐 Thursday Morning: Fix bugs and deploy to GitHub pages.
